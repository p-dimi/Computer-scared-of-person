# Computer-scared-of-person!
This is a small experiment in fear simulation.

The goal of this was to create a simple mechanism that detects when a person is approaching the camera too fast,  causing a startled reaction in the computer.

The fear is expressed in the black and white display box to the left of the camera display.
The whiter the box, the higher the fear.

The fear levels fluctuate in a manner close to organic. This is all in order to appear as organic fear, even though it is anything but.

Utilizes Yolo3 light for lightning fast object recognition.
